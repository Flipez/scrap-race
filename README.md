# Scrap Race

A puzzle adventure game by [Flipez](https://github.com/Flipez) and [Kjarrigan](https://github.com/Kjarrigan) featuring our protagonist Scrat, who is a treasure hunter travelling through space to find the stuff from the good ol' days )instead of the valuable stuff his coworkers seek). He is a bit lazy which makes his journey unnecessarily harder...

This is our game entry for the [GODOT WILD JAM # 35 - LOST TECH](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-35)

We did some smaller games with Godot before but it's the first time we work together as a team to participate in a public Game Jam.
